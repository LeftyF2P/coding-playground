[ODYSSEUS]
Alright my brothers listen closely
Tonight we make the Trojans pay
Ten years of war they killed us slowly
But now we'll be the ones who slay
Think of your wives and your children
Your families wonder where you've been
They're growing old and yet you're still here
Do what I say and you'll see them again

[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

[ODYSSEUS]
Diomedes will lead the charge
Agamemnon will flank the guards
Menelaus will let our mates through the gates to takе the whole city at large
Tеucer will shoot any ambush attack
And Little Ajax will stay back
Nestor, secure Helen and protect her
Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector!

[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

[ODYSSEUS]
Find that inner strength now
Use that well of pride
Fight through every pain now
Ask yourself inside
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?

[SOLDIERS]
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?

[ODYSSEUS]
Penelope, Penelope
And Telemachus
I fight for us, I fight for us

[SOLDIERS]
What do you live for?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Penelope...

[SOLDIERS]
What do you try for?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Telemachus...

[SOLDIERS]
What do you wish for?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I'm on my way!

[SOLDIERS]
What do you fight for?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Attack!

[Instrumental with battle cries, ending with a cry of anguish from Odysseus]

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Argh!
Who was that?

[ZEUS]
A vision of what is to come
Cannot be outrun
Can only be dealt with right here and now

[ODYSSEUS]
Tell me how

[ZEUS]
I don't think you're ready
A mission to kill someone's son
A foe who won't run
Unlike anyone you have faced before

[ODYSSEUS]
Say no more, I know that I'm ready

[ZEUS & GODS]
I don't think you're ready

[ODYSSEUS]
It's just an infant...
It's just a boy...
What sort of imminent threat does he pose that I can not avoid?

[ZEUS]
This is the son of none other than Troy's very own prince Hector
Know that he will grow from a boy to an avenger
One fumed with rage as you're consumed by age

[ZEUS & GODS]
If you don't end him now you'll have no one left to save

[ZEUS]
You can say goodbye to

[GODS]
Penelope

[ZEUS]
You can say goodbye to

[GODS]
Penelope

[ODYSSEUS, ZEUS & GODS]
I could raise him as my own (He will burn your house and throne)
Or send him far away from home (He'll find you wherever you go)
Make sure his past is never known (The gods will make it known)
I'd rather bleed for you, down on my knees for you (We're bringing you down on your knees for you)
I'm begging please
Oh, this is the will of the gods

[ODYSSEUS]
Please don't make me do this, don't make me do this

[ZEUS]
The blood on your hands is something you won't lose

[ZEUS & GODS]
All you can choose is whose
