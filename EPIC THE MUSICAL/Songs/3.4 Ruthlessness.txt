[POSEIDON]
In all my years of living
It isn't very often that I get pissed off
I try to chill with the waves
But damn, you've crossed the line

I've been so gracious
And yet, you hurt the son of mine
That's right, the cyclops you made blind, is mine

[ODYSSEUS]
No

[POSEIDON, LAESTRYGONIANS]
I'm left without a choice
And without a doubt
Guess the pack of wolves is swimming with the shark now
I've gotta make you bleed
I need to see you drown
But before you go, I need to make you learn how

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mеrcy upon ourselves
Ourselves

You are the worse kind of good
Cause you're not even great
A Greek who reeks of false righteousness
That's what I hate

Cause you fight to save lives
But won't kill and don't get the job done
I mean you totally could have avoided all this
Had you just killed my son
But no

You are far too nice
Mercy has a price
It's the final crack we're about to break the ice now
You reveal your name
Then you let him live
Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give cause

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves

And now it is finally time
To say goodbye
Today, you die
Unless, of course, you apologize
For my son's pain
And all his cries

[ODYSSEUS]
Poseidon, we meant no harm
We only hurt him to disarm him
We took no pleasure in his pain
We only wanted to escape

[POSEIDON]
The line between naïveté and
Hopefulness is almost invisible
So close your heart
The world is dark and

[POSEIDON & LAESTRYGONIANS]
Ruthlessness is mercy-

[POSEIDON]
Die

[LAESTRYGONIANS, CREW]
Ruthlessness is mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is

[ODYSSEUS]
What have you done?

[ENSEMBLE]
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?

[POSEIDON]
Forty-three left under your command

[ENSEMBLE]
When does man become a monster?

[POSEIDON]
I am your darkest moment
The monster that always draws near
Any last words?

[ODYSSEUS]
All I gotta do is open this bag

[POSEIDON]
What?

Remember me
