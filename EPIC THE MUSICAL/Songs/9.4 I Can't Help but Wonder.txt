[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Father?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...Son!

[TELEMACHUS]
All my life, I'd have died to meet you
Thought about your name so much it hurts
For twenty years, I'd dreamt of how I'd greet you
Oh, and now you're here
I can't find the words

All my life I'd have died to know you
Days and nights I wish that I could show you
For twenty years I never could outgrow you
Oh, and now you're here

I can't help but wonder
What your world must be
If we're like each other
If I have your strength in me
All this time I've wondered
If you'd embrace me as your own
Twenty years I've wandered
For so long I've felt alone

[ODYSSEUS]
Oh my son, look how much you've grown
Oh my boy, the sweetest joy I've known
Twenty years ago I held you in my arms
How time has flown, oh

Used to say I'd make the storm clouds cry for you
Used to say I'd capture wind and sky for you
Held you in my arms prepared to die for you, oh
How time has flown

I can only wonder
What your world has been
Things you've had to suffer
And the strength you hold within
All I've ever wanted
Was to reunite with my own
Twenty years we've wandered
But today you're not alone

My son, I'm finally home!

[ENSEMBLE]
Home, home

[TELEMACHUS]
Father, how I've longed to see you!

[ENSEMBLE]
Home, home

[ODYSSEUS, TELEMACHUS]
Telemachus, I'm home (Home)

[ODYSSEUS]
Go, tell your mother I'm home
I'll be there in a moment

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Of course

[ODYSSEUS]
Show yourself
I know you're watching me
Show yourself
You were never one for hellos

[ATHENA]
I can't help but wonder
What this world could be
If we all held each other with a bit more empathy
I can't help but feel like
I led you astray
What if there's a world where we don't have to live this way?

[ODYSSEUS]
If that world exists
It's far away from here
It's one I'll have to miss
For it's far beyond my years
You might live forever
So you can make it be
But I've got one endeavor
There's a girl I have to see

[ATHENA, spoken]
Very well...

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Father? She's waiting for you!
