[POSEIDON, spoken]
There you are, coward...

[POSEIDON]
I've been waiting for this moment
For the perfect time to strike
When your home's so close and you've reached your coast
That's when our paths collide
I've got a reputation
I've got a name to uphold
So I can't go letting you walk
Or else the world forgets I'm cold

Now get in the water
Get in the water
Or I'll raise the tide so high, all of Ithaca will die
Get in the water

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Wait...

[POSEIDON]
Get in the water

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Stop this, please!

[POSEIDON]
I'll make tidal waves so profound
Both your wife and your son will drown

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
No!

[POSEIDON & ENSEMBLE]
Get in the water
Get in the water
Don't mistake my threats for bluff
You have lived more than enough
Get in the water
Get in the water
I'll take your son and gouge his eyes
That is, unless you choose to die
Get in the water

[ODYSSEUS]
Aren't you tired, Poseidon?
It's been ten years, how long will this go?
We're both hurting from losses
So why not leave this here and just go home?

[POSEIDON, spoken]
...I can't.

[ODYSSEUS]
Maybe you could learn to forgive

[POSEIDON, spoken]
No.

[POSEIDON]
RUTHLESSNESS IS...
...MERCY UPON....
...OURSELVES!!!

[POSEIDON, spoken]
DIE!!!

[Instrumental Break]

[POLITES]
You can relax, my friend
I can tell you're getting nervous

[EURYLOCHUS]
Look at all we've lost and all we've learned

[ANTICLEA]
I'll stay in your heart

[CREW]
Oh, woah, Odysseus
Waiting, waiting, waiting, ah
