[ODYSSEUS]
These waves and tides have grown in strength and size
Is it nature or divine or a blessing in disguise?
Our home's in sight, this storm's our final fight
There's no time to die

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Comrades!

[CREW, spoken]
Sir!

[ODYSSEUS, CREW]
Brace for a storm (Storm)
The likes of which we've never seen before
Brace for a storm (Storm)
With home so close, we must keep pushing forward

[SOLDIERS]
Full speed ahead!

[ODYSSEUS]
Head towards the island but avoid the crashing waves
Tread where the tide is flat and then you will be safе

[EURYLOCHUS]
Captain, we will capsize with these waves, our fleet will fail

[ODYSSEUS, CREW]
Have them follow my ship, I'll ensure that we prevail
Storm (Storm)

[EURYLOCHUS]
We're taking too much damage to survive

[ODYSSEUS, CREW]
We'll beat this storm (Storm)

[EURYLOCHUS]
At this rate, we won't make it out alive

[PERIMEDES & ELPENOR, spoken]
Captain, look!

[ODYSSEUS & EURYLOCHUS]
An island in the sky...

[ODYSSEUS]
Eurylochus grab the harpoons.
As many as you can find.

[EURYLOCHUS]
What do you have in mind?

[ODYSSEUS]
We're gonna shoot for the sky.

[EURYLOCHUS]
What?

[CREW]
Storm! Storm!

[ODYSSEUS]
Everyone grab a harpoon and aim it high!

[CREW]
Storm! Storm!

[ODYSSEUS]
We're shooting for the island in the sky!
In the sky!
