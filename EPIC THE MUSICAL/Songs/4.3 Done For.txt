[ODYSSEUS]
Lady of the palace,
Sorry that I ask this
But I hope that I’ve been misinformed.
I sent out some scouts to take a look around through here
And they wound up at your doors.

Through the years we seldom
Get a warm welcome,
So I must ask just to be sure:

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Did you do something to them?

[CIRCE]
Who, me? All I did was reveal their true forms.

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
You turned them into pigs.

[CIRCE]
Ha!
I don't know who you are nor why you're here,
But let me make this one thing clear:
I‘ve got people to protect,
Nymphs I can't neglect. So I'm not taking chances, dear.
If you make one wrong move then you're done for!
Anything I don't approve, then you're done for!
I could put a spell on you, and you're done for.
Boy, you better run or soon you will be done for.

[ODYSSEUS]
I don't mean to tip your scale
But you will fail at placing any spells on me.
I just ate a flower,
One that claims your power,
So you better cower now and flee.

[CIRCE]
You must be a liar!
Mortals can't acquire Moly without dire consequence.

[ODYSSEUS]
Then I must be a god like you
Cause I got this root
From the ground with my bare hands.

[CIRCE, spoken]
Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Okay, fine, yes. But regardless!

[ODYSSEUS]
You and I are now evenly matched.
Our fates are intertwined, they're attached.

[CIRCE and ODYSSEUS]
I’ve got people to protect.
Friends I can't neglect.
So now there is no turning back.
You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for.
I will be the one to prove that you're done for.
Not even a spell saves you cause you're done for.
Oh you better run or soon you will be done for.

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
You've lost.

[CIRCE]
My nymphs are like my daughters, I protect them at all costs.
The last time we let strangers live, we faced a heavy loss.
You've given me no reason to bestow you with my trust.
But everyone's true colors are revealed in acts of lust.

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I'm not sure I follow.
