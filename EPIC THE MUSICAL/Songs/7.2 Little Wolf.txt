Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain me?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

You've made your worst mistake here,
might be your last one too
You'll have run out of bones to break
when you and I are through
I'll teach you all the lessons
your daddy never could
This cruel world doesn't give out presents
just for being good, So

Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain mе?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Lеt's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
Or die, little wolf, die
Don't you know it's fight or
Fly, little wolf, fly
All because you had to
Try, little wolf try
Run away before you
Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die

[ATHENA, spoken]
Need some help?

[TELEMACHUS]
What's going on here?

[ATHENA]
Is your plan to stand around?
Cause I suggest you fight back

[TELEMACHUS]
I don't know how

[ATHENA, spoken]
Uppercut him, now.

[TELEMACHUS]
Woah, how did I do that?
Is time now moving slow?

[ATHENA]
No, I just made your thoughts quick

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Woah, that is so sick!

[ATHENA, spoken]
Alright now, let's try this again.

[ATHENA]
I've no respect for bullies
Those who impose their will
I've seen plenty enough to truly understand this kind of filth
Let's teach this dog a lesson
In front of all his kind
One young wolf has a larger heart than all these men combined

Fight, little wolf, fight
Show them that you've got some
Bite, little wolf, bite
Take advantage now and
Strike, little wolf, strike
Don't go down without a
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf
Get up and fight

Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then Oh
Fight, little wolf Fight
Fight, little wolf
Fight

[ATHENA, spoken]
Oh! Maybe I pushed you a bit too hard!

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Ow...

[ANTINOUS]
Go back and cry in your corner
Make sure your mother hears
If she won't choose a man to adorn her
We'll bring blood and tears

[TELEMACHUS]
Tell me, Athena, why you came to my aid
