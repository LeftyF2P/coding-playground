[TIRESIAS]
I am the prophet with the answers you seek
Time, I've unlocked it
I see past and future running free
There is a world where I help you get home
But that's not a world I know

[ODYSSEUS]
What?

[TIRESIAS]
I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of man
I see portrayals of betrayal
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death
I see you draw your final breath
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
But it's no longer you

[ODYSSEUS]
This can't be
We've suffered and sailed through the toughest of hells
Now you tell us our effort's for nothing?!

[TIRESIAS]
I see your palace covered in red
Faces of men who had long believed you're dead
I see your wife with a man who is haunting
A man with a trail of bodies

[ODYSSEUS]
WHO?!?!

[TIRESIAS, ENSEMBLE]
I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of man
I see portrayals of betrayal
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death (Siren song, Scylla throat)
I see you draw your final breath (Mutiny, Lightning bolt)
I see a man who gets to make it home alive (Hurt Poseidon, Kill all the suitors for love)
But it's no longer you
