[CIRCE]
There are other ways of persuasion
There are other modes of control
There are other means of deceit
There are other roads to the soul
There are other actions of passion
You have so much left to learn
Want to save your men from the fire?
Show me that you're willing to burn, woah


[ODYSSEUS, CIRCE]
Who's to say, with the mistakes I've made (Don't be afraid)
That they will be the last (Think of your past)
Mistakes I ever make? (Don't break when)

[ODYSSEUS & CIRCE]
There is so much power, so much power
But there's no puppet here


[CIRCE, ODYSSEUS]
This is the price we pay to love (I'm just a man)
There is no line, never enough (I'm just a man)
So much power, so much power (Forgive me)
But there's no puppet here


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I can't!

[ODYSSEUS]
Back at home, my wife awaits for me
She's my everything, my Penelope
And she's all my power, all my power
But it's been twelve long years
Oh, twelve long years since I have seen my wife
And now the god of tides is out to end my life
So I beg you, Circe, grant us mercy
And let us puppets leave


[CIRCE, spoken]
(Sigh) Poseidon, eh?


[CIRCE]
There might be a way to evade him
There might be a way to get home
Though this other way's very dangerous
It might be your one final hope
I know of a brilliant prophet
Problem is, this prophet is dead
I can't get you home
But I'll get you to the Underworld instead
I'll release your men
And I'll get you to the Underworld instead

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Wait, you're helping us?


[CIRCE]
There are many ways of persuasion
There are many modes of control
Maybe showing one act of kindness
Leads to kinder souls down the road
I remember actions of passion
I have been in love once before
Maybe one day, the world will need a puppeteer no more
Oh, maybe one day, the world will need a puppeteer
More

[CREW]
So much power, so much power
But there's no puppet here
No, she's not a player, she's a puppeteer
No, she's not a player, she's a puppeteer, yeah
