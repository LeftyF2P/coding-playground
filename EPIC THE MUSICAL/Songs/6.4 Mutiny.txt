[EURYLOCHUS]
Tell me, you did not know that would happen
Say, you didn't know how that would end
Look me in the eyes and tell me, Captain
That you did not just sacrifice six men
Use your wits to try and say I'm crazy and mad
That this is all some trick the gods have sent
Tell, me you did not miss home so painfully bad
That you gave up the lives of six of our friends

When we fought the cyclops
You were quick to hatch a plan
And when we fought with Circe
It was you who left behind no man
But when we saw this monster, we didn't take a stand
We just ran

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
Say something!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I can't!

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
Then you have forced my hand...

[CREW]
Eurylochus

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Lower your weapon!

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
No can do.

[EURYLOCHUS]
You miss your wife so bad
You trade the lives of your own crew

[ODYSSEUS]
Don't make me fight you, brother
You know you'd have done the same

[EURYLOCHUS]
If you want all the power
You must carry all the BLAME!

[ODYSSEUS and EURYLOCHUS face off]

[CREW]
Eurylochus, Eurylochus, Eurylochus
Odysseus, Odysseus, Odysseus
There is no price he won't pay

[ODYSSEUS]
I am not letting you get in my way

[PERIMEDES stabs ODYSSEUS. ODYSSEUS gasps for air.]

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
My brothers, why?

[PERIMEDES]
How are we supposed to trust you now?

[CREW]
Now your time has come, your luck's run out
Now, the time has come to shut you down
You relied on wit, and then we died on it, woah

[EURYLOCHUS knocks out ODYSSEUS]

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Argh, my head
Where are we?

[Cattle can be heard nearby.]

[EURYLOCHUS]
Some island
The first one we found, it's bursting with cows
Just roaming around, begging us to eat
So much meat, and hunger is so heavy
This statue, the god of the sun
Don't know where it's from
But here's where we found all these cows to hunt
Right in front, and hunger is so heavy

[CREW]
Hunger is so heavy

[ODYSSEUS]
Please don't tell me you're about to do
What I think you'll do

[EURYLOCHUS, ODYSSEUS]
Ody, we're never gonna get to make it home
You know it's true
You don't know that's true
This is the home of the sun god
I'm starving, my friend
But if you kill his cattle, who knows what he'll send?
This is the home of the sun god
I'm tired, my friend
But we're so close to home, this can't be where it ends

How much longer must I suffer now?
Please don't do this
How much longer must I push through doubt?
I need to get home
How much longer must I go about
Eurylochus
My life like this, when people die like this? Woah

[EURYLOCHUS & CREW, ODYSSEUS]
How much longer must we suffer now?
Reconsider
How much longer must we push through doubt?
We can get home
How much longer must we go about
Eurylochus
Our lives like this, when people die like this? Woah

[EURYLOCHUS]
I'm just a man!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Eurylochus, NO!!!

[EURYLOCHUS slits a cow's throat]

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
You've doomed us
YOU'VE DOOMED US ALL, EURYLOCHUS!!!

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
Captain?

[ODYSSEUS]
We need to get away from this island now
Grab an oar with all the strength your arms allow
These cows were immortal, they were the sun god's friends
And now that we've pissed him off
WHO DO YOU THINK HE'LL SEND?!

[CREW, ODYSSEUS]
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead (Faster!)
Full speed ahead (Faster!)
Full speed ahead

[Thunder crashes in the distance.]

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...We're too late.
