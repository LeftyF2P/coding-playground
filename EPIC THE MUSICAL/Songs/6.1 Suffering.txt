[SIRENS]
Penelope (Ah; ooh)
Penelope (Ah; ooh)

["PENELOPE"]
Don't you miss me?

[ODYSSEUS]
More than you know

["PENELOPE"]
Then jump in the water and kiss me

[ODYSSEUS]
Penelope, I've told you this before
You know I'm afraid of the water

["PENELOPE"]
I'll make sure that you are safe and sound
Come play with me and our daughter
And let's watch our love leave the ground

[ODYSSEUS, "PENELOPE"]
Oh, I would
But I'd be suffering trying to float the whole time
I would take the suffering from you
Ooh, as good as that sounds, right here I'm just fine
I can take the suffering from you
You know that I prefer my feet on the ground
I will take the suffering from you
Fine, but only if you answer a question or two


["PENELOPE", spoken]
Of course!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Okay! So, let's say I was on the run. Or hiding!
From, I don't know, Poseidon?
And let's say he blocked the way home
With giant waves and giant storms!

["PENELOPE", spoken]
Oh no...

[ODYSSEUS]
How am I to evade him?
How am I to get home?
Which route should I take?
Where am I supposed to go?

["PENELOPE"]
He will chase you high and low
So find a place he'd never go
The one way you'll get home
Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh
It's through the lair of Scylla

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
No...

["PENELOPE"]
This is your only way home
The lair of Scylla

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
But Scylla has a cost!

["PENELOPE"]
Well, you asked and now you know

["PENELOPE", spoken]
Now jump in the water!

[ODYSSEUS, "PENELOPE"]
Penelope, why?
You know I'm too shy and terrified
I would take the suffering from you
Ooh, for you I would die
But can't you let me stay dry?
I can take the suffering from you
You should come onto the ship
We'll jump at the same time
I will take the suffering from you
(Sigh) The things I do for you...
