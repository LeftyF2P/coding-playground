[ZEUS]
Pride is a damsel in distress
Hiding away where only I can undress her
Try all she can not to confess
In the end, it's all the same once I apply all the pressure

Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her
Show her what she can't conceal
For true nature will be revealed

Tell me, Odysseus
If I were to make you choose
The lives of your men and crew or your own
Why do I think they'd lose?
Enlighten me, King of Ithaca
Since hunger was far too great
I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned
And suffer a gruesome fate to the

Thunder bringer, here to ring your
Ears until you're deaf with fear
And spear you while your death is near
Lightning wielder, here to yield your
Time, for you have passed your prime
Sublime you for your act of crime

[ZEUS, spoken]
Choose.

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...Choose?

[ZEUS]
Someone's gotta die today
And you have got the final say

[ZEUS, spoken]
You? Or your crew?

[ODYSSEUS]
Please don't make me do this
Don't make me do this

[CREW, PENELOPE]
When does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze?
I can take the suffering from you
When does a man become a monster?
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame?
Let me take the suffering from—
When does a man become a monster?

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
...Captain?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I have to see her.

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
But we'll die...

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...I know.

[ZEUS]
Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her
Show her what she can't conceal
For true nature will be revealed
