[ATHENA]
Old friend, it's been ten years since I last saw you

[ODYSSEUS]
Remember me, I am the infamous...
ODYSSEUS!!!

[CREW]
Oh, woah, woah, woah

[ATHENA]
Let's see where you've been

[AEOLUS]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer

[POSEIDON]
Ruthlessness is mercy upon oursel—

[CIRCE]
One wrong move and you're done for
Anything I—

[TIRESIAS]
—song of past romance
I see the—

[CREW]
We won't take more suffering from you

[SCYLLA]
Drown in your sorrow and fears

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
 ...Captain?
 
[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I have to see her.

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
But we'll die...
 
[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...I know.

[ATHENA, spoken]
Odysseus, where did you go?

[CALYPSO]
Morning, sleepyhead, you've been resting for a while
I swore that you were dead when you washed up on my isle
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
Tell me, though, who's Penelope?

[ODYSSEUS]
She's my wife

[PAUSE]

[CALYPSO]
Anyways, I've got all you could want here
All you could need here
Just you and me, my dear, my love for life
Soon, into bed we'll climb and spend our time

[ODYSSEUS]
I'm not your man

[CALYPSO]
I'm what you want here, I'm what you need here
Just you and me, my love in paradise
Now 'til the end of time
From here on out, you're mine, all mine

[ODYSSEUS]
Hell no, I could kill you where you stand
I'm no pet, I'm a married man

[CALYPSO]
Oh handsome, you may try
But last I checked, goddesses can't die

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Goddess?

[CALYPSO]
You're adorable
Bow down now to the immortal Calypso, here to entertain
But fear not, I bring no pain
'Cause we got
All we could want here, all we could need here
Under my spell, we're stuck in paradise
No one can come or go, my island stays unknown

[ODYSSEUS]
No, no, I don't belong here
There's something wrong here
I won't be drawn to love in paradise
Not 'til the end of time, there is no way

[CALYPSO]
You're mine, all mine

[ATHENA]
Seven years she's kept you trapped, outta your control
Time can take a heavy toll

[CALYPSO, spoken]
Odysseus?

[ODYSSEUS]
All I hear are screams

[CALYPSO, spoken]
Ody, get away from the ledge!

[ODYSSEUS]
You don't know what I've gone through
You don't know what I've sacrificed
Every comrade I long knew
Every friend, I saw them die
And all I hear are screams

[CALYPSO]
It will be fine, dear, come back inside, dear
Love of my life, come back to paradise

[ODYSSEUS]
Let me close my eyes

[CALYPSO]
I know your life's been hard, I'll stay inside your heart

[ODYSSEUS]
All I hear are screams

[CALYPSO]
I love you, my dear, I love our time here
Life would be so much worse if you had died

[ODYSSEUS]
Just let me close my eyes

[CALYPSO]
Please stay away from harm, stay in my open arms

[ODYSSEUS]
All I hear are—

[POLITES, EURYLOCHUS, ANTICLEA, ODYSSEUS]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
How much longer 'til your luck runs out?
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
Oh
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
How much longer 'til we all fall down? You rely on wit—
Oh
Waiting, waiting
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open—

[ODYSSEUS]
ATHENA!!
