[ODYSSEUS]
Friends, Circe's instructions were clear
No matter what we hear

[CREW]
Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS]
Until we find the prophet
My comrades, this land confuses your mind
So no matter who we find

[CREW]
Full speed ahead, until we find the prophet

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Good...

[Instrumental]

[ODYSSEUS, CREW]
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems (Nothing's what it seems)
And here in the Underworld, the past seems close behind
This land confuses your mind

[FALLEN SOLDIERS]
When does a man become a monster?
558 men who died under your command
Captain, captain, captain, captain
Why would you let the cyclops live
When ruthlessness is mercy?

[ODYSSEUS, CREW, ALL]
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems (Nothing's what it seems)
But in the Underworld, the past seems close behind
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
I keep thinking of the infant from that night

[POLITES]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]
Polites

[POLITES]
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]
Polites

[ANTICLEA]
Waiting

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
That voice, it can't be...

[ANTICLEA]
Waiting

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Mom?

[ANTICLEA, ODYSSEUS, BOTH]
Waiting
Odysseus, when you come home, I'll be waiting
Even if you're the last thing I see, I'll be waiting
I'm right here, mom (Waiting)
Can't you see? I'm waiting
I took too long (I'll always love you)
And ventured too far (I'll stay in your heart)
While you were waiting, waiting, waiting

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Bye, mom...

[ODYSSEUS, CREW, ALL]
All I hear are screams (All I hear are screams)
Every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream (I no longer dream)
Only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems (Nothing's what it seems)
But in the Underworld, your past is always close behind
Your past is always close behind
Down in the Underworld
