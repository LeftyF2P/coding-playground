[ODYSSEUS]
Great Wind God Aeolus
I don't know if you know this
But our path to home is blocked by an impenetrable storm
I ask for your assistance
So we at last can go the distance
Can you cast the perfect winds for us and aid our journey home?

[AEOLUS]
Ha ha ha
I am the wind, twisting and turning
I give the fire enough to stay burning
Let's play a game

[ODYSSEUS]
A game?

[AEOLUS]
That's what I'm serving
And if you win, you will get what you're yearning

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Deal!

[AEOLUS]
Take a look right here at this bag
It has the winds of the storm all trapped
All you gotta do is not open this bag

[ODYSSEUS]
Sounds too easy, what's the catch?

[AEOLUS, WINIONS]
Ha ha ha!
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never rеally know who you can trust
If they wanna get the bag open, you gotta say "no, sir"
Sometimes killing is a must

[ODYSSEUS]
What?

[AEOLUS]
Cause the end always justifies the means
Friends turn into foes in rivalries
So keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust

[PERIMEDES & ELPENOR]
Captain! What's happening?
What's trapped in that bag?

[ODYSSEUS]
Something dangerous, friends!
We mustn't lag!

[WINIONS]
It's treasure!

[ODYSSEUS]
What?

[WINIONS]
Buh-bye!

[PERIMEDES]
Open the bag!

[ELPENOR]
Let's see what you got!

[ODYSSEUS]
No, do not!
Everybody listen closely
See how the bag is closed?
That's how it's supposed to be
This bag has the storm inside!
We cannot let the treasure rumor fly!

[PERIMEDES & ELPENOR]
We'll try!

[AEOLUS, CREW & WINIONS]
Keep your friends and your enemies closer!
Never really know who you can trust!
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure!
Sometimes, sneaking is a must!
Cause the end always justifies the means
Everything's changed since Polites, so!
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer!
Never really know who you can trust!

[ODYSSEUS, CREW]
For nine days, I've stayed wide awake
Tryna make it home with no storm or tidal wave
I remain unopposed, the bag is still closed
And I'm getting closer to you...
Penelope
I can't wait to make some new memories...
Telemachus
Time for me to be the father I never was

[ODYSSEUS, PENELOPE & TELEMACHUS]
Just keep your eyes open
Why are my eyes and my heart and my soul so heavy
Just keep your eyes open
I keep on trying to embrace you both, why won't you let me
Just keep your eyes open
So much has changed, but I'm the same, yes I'm the same
'Just keep your eyes open'

[CREW]
Keep your eyes open

[PENELOPE]
Wake up!
Wake up, Odysseus, they're opening the bag
Wake up!

[ODYSSEUS]
No!
