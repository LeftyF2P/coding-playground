[ATHENA]
I had a friend before, and
He was a lot like you
I helped him fight through war, but
He had his demons too
And then we grew apart
Then his light went dark

And so, I thought
Maybe, if I made a different call
Maybe if I hadn't missed it all
Maybe, he'd be fine
Maybe we'd unwind
Maybe, if I help another soul
Maybe, if I helped you reach your goal
Life could be that bright
I could sleep at night

[TELEMACHUS]
Athena, I don't know who your friend is
I don't know what he's like, but
My time with you has been splendid
The best day of my life
Cause I got in a fight, and I didn't die

I've never felt strong before
You're my friend, I couldn't ask for more
And so, I think

Maybe, if life wasn't spent as planned
Maybe, it's time that you lend a hand
I don't think he'll mind
If not his friend, then mine

[TELEMACHUS & ATHENA]
Maybe, to fall is to learn one way
Maybe, it's all gonna turn out great
I know we'll be fine
I know it's light you'll find

[ATHENA]
You're a good kid

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Thanks!
