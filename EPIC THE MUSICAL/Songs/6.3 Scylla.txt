[ODYSSEUS]
The lair of Scylla
This is our only way home

[SCYLLA]
Deep down

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
You're quiet today.

[SCYLLA]
Deep down

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Not much to say...

[SCYLLA & CREW]
Deep down, you hide a reason for shame

[EURYLOCHUS]
I've got a secret I can no longer keep

[SCYLLA & CREW]
Deep down, you know that we are the same

[EURYLOCHUS]
I opened the wind bag while you were asleep

[SCYLLA, EURYLOCHUS]
Leaving them feeling betrayed
Breaking the bonds that you've made (I'm so sorry)
There is no price we won't pay (Forgive me)
We both know what it takes to survive

[CREW]
Full speed ahead
(Full speed ahead)
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

[SCYLLA & CREW]
Deep down, we only care for ourselves

[ODYSSEUS]
Eurylochus, light up six torches

[SCYLLA]
Deep down, we're lonely demons from hell

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
Captain! Something approaches...

[SCYLLA, spoken]
Hello...

[Instrumental Break]

[ODYSSEUS]
Row for your lives!

[SCYLLA]
Drown in your sorrow and fears
Choke on your blood and your tears
Bleed 'til you've run out of years
We must do what it takes to survive

Give up your honor and faith
Live up your life as a wraith
Die in the blood where you bathe
We must do what it takes to survive

[SCYLLA & ODYSSEUS]
We are the same, you and I, I
