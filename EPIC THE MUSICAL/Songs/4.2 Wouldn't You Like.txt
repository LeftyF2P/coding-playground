[HERMES]
I must say what a brilliant speech you gave

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Who goes there?

[HERMES]
Just a friend who could help you save your men
A foe like Circe is not to be messed with
You want to beat her?
You'll need the blessing of a certain god
Divine intervention
Someone who's not afraid to send a message

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Hermes?

[HERMES]
Hahahahaha
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to havе some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcomе preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
She can turn you into an animal that'll end up on her plate
She can all but make you fall in love like you're on your hundredth date
She can conjure up a monster that'll grind you to the bones
She has all the ways to haunt ya when you take her on alone

[HERMES & ENSEMBLE]
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
Oh

[HERMES]
Here in the root of this flower
There lies such a power to take her on
You must consume and digest it
Then you'll manifest a being of your creation
All you need's imagination
Though it's only for a moment
Till you've beaten your opponent

[HERMES, spoken]
And I call this root: Holy Moly

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Ah

[HERMES]
Hahahahahaha!

[HERMES & ENSEMBLE]
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

[HERMES & ENSEMBLE, ODYSSEUS]
(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
(Oh) Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
(Oh) Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
(Oh) Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Hermes
Thank you

[HERMES]
Don't thank me friend
You very well may die
Haha, good luck
