[EURYLOCHUS]
Captain...
I have something that I must confess
Something that I must get off my chest
Until it is said, I cannot rest
Captain?

[ODYSSEUS]
Eurylochus
go make sure this island is secure

[EURYLOCHUS]
But captain...

[ODYSSEUS]
There's only so much left we can endure
Whatever you need to say can wait some more
Of that, I'm sure

[EURYLOCHUS]
Okay.

[Instrumental]

[ODYSSEUS]
Eurylochus back so soon?
Where's the rest of your crew?
By the gods, what happened to you?!

[EURYLOCHUS]
We came across a palace
Inside we heard a voice
It seemed to show no malice
To greet it was our choice, but nothing could prepare us for the power
that awaited inside...

[ODYSSEUS]
What did this palace hide?

[EURYLOCHUS]
Sir, since we left home we've faced a variety of foes from a wide range of places
Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist
But this was a hell of a twist, cause we are weak to a power like this

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
What was it?

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
A woman!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
What?

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
She had us in just two words

[CIRCE]
Come inside

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Damn

[CIRCE]
Welcome to the best part of your lives
Go ahead and rest wherever you like
I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
Only I stayеd outside, but the rest wеnt in

[CIRCE, SOLDIERS]
Take a seat Aye!
Let me bring you all something to eat Aye!
I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet Aye!
I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
By the time they ate, it was far too late

[EURYLOCHUS, CIRCE]
For inside the meal, think of your past
She had cast a spell, and your mistakes
They began to squeal, they'll be the last
And grow snouts and tails, mistakes you'll make
She changed them

[CIRCE]
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

[EURYLOCHUS, CIRCE]
They transformed, this is the price
And it wasn't quick, we pay to live
She turned our men, the world does not
From men to pigs, tend to forgive
She changed them

[CIRCE]
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
We have to go save them

[EURYLOCHUS]
No we don't
Look at all we've lost and all we've learned
Every single cost is so much more than what we've earned
Think about the men we have left before there are none
Let's just cut our losses, you are I, and let's run

[ODYSSEUS]
Of course I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run
But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done
There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save
I can only hope you'd do the same


[EURYLOCHUS, CIRCE]
I can hear her still no one will find
And her voice deceives their way between
What if she can't be killed? my nymphs and I,
Will you choose to leave? their loving queen

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I don't know

[CIRCE]
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

[EURYLOCHUS, CIRCE]
She's a clever witch this is the price
And she's hard to slay we pay to love
It's a game of wits we draw the line
But you don't have to play watch from above

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I have to try

[CIRCE]
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah
