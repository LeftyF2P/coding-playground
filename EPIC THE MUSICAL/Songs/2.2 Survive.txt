Po-ly-phe-mus
Po-ly-phe-mus

[ODYSSEUS]
My brothers
The rest of our fleet
They wait at the beach
And if we're defeated, they're good as dead
Straight ahead, that is who we're fighting

[ENSEMBLE]
Po-ly-phe-mus

[ODYSSEUS]
No backup, no chance for support
So draw out your swords
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
Show me, how great is your will to survive?

Six hundred lives at stake, it's just one life to take
And when we kill him, then our journey's over
No dying on me now, defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day
So fight, fight, fight

[Battle sounds]

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
Surround him! (Surround him!)
Attack from behind, keep distance in mind
And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels (Strike the heels!)
Show him that we're deadly (Ha! Ha!)

Exhaust him (Exhaust him!)
Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach
Find a breach
Stand up and fight for your lives

[SOLDIERS]
Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey's over

[ODYSSEUS]
Push forward!

[SOLDIERS]
No dying on us now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight

[Battle sounds]

[POLITES, spoken]
Captain…

[POLYPHEMUS, spoken]
Enough

[SOLDIER, spoken]
He's got a club…
HE'S GOT A CLU-!

[SOLDIER, spoken]
What are our orders?
Captain? CAPTAI-!

[POLYPHEMUS]
You've hurt me enough
Six hundred lives I'll take
Six hundred lives I'll break
And when I kill you then my pain is over
You're dying here and now
Escape is not allowed
You won't live through this day, now die, di-i-i—
