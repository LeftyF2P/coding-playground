[ODYSSEUS grabs his bow and arrow and shoots "PENELOPE." The SIREN screams in pain.]

[ODYSSEUS]
Let's cut the charade, you are no wife of mine
You've been tryin' to take my life this whole time
I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding
Yeah, I know exactly what you are, a siren

[The SIREN hisses at ODYSSEUS]

[ODYSSEUS]
My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water
And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter
But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks
You didn't notice that your friends got snatched

[SIREN, spoken]
What?!

[ODYSSEUS]
We are a different beast now
We are the ones who feast now
No more of us deceased
'Cause we won't take more suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS & CREW]
We are the man-made monsters
We are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer
We won't take more suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
We've been away from home for
About twelve years or so
First, we slayed in our own war
And now, we're here with more foes
While on the run from Poseidon
We found a ship with no crew
I realized nearby, there were sirens
Singing sailors to their dooms

We filled our ears with beeswax
That's how we resist your song
You pretended to be my wife
So I just played along
I read your lips and phrases
Scanning for information
Sirens know about every route and horizon
Now I know how to get back to my island

[CREW]
We are a different beast now
We are the ones who feast now
No more of us deceased
'Cause we won't take more suffering from you
We are the man-made monsters
We are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer
We won't take more suffering from you

[SIRENS]
Spare us
Oh, spare us, please

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Why?!

[ODYSSEUS]
So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?
Nah, you wouldn't have spared me
I made a mistake like this, it almost cost my life
I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife
Cut off their tails! We're ending this now
Throw their bodies back in the water
Let them drown

[SIRENS, spoken]
NO!

[CREW]
He is a different beast now
He is the one who feasts now
No more of us deceased
'Cause he won't take more suffering from you
He is the man-made monster
He is the one who conquers
You are a threat no longer
He won't take more suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS, CREW]
Kill them all (Oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, woah)
Kill them all (Oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, woah)
Kill them all (Oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, woah)
Kill 'em all

[CREW]
Oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, woah
