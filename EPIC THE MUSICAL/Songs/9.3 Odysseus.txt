[ODYSSEUS]
For twenty years I've suffered every punishment and pain
From the wrath of gods and monsters
To the screams of comrades slain
I come back and find my palace desecrated, sacked like Troy
Worst of all, I hear you dare to touch my wife and hurt my boy!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I... have had.... enough...

[SUITOR #1]
In the heat of battle at the edge of the unknown

[SUITOR #2]
Somewhere in the shadows lurks an agile, deadly foe

[SUITOR #3]
We have the advantage. We've the numbers and the might

[SUITOR #4]
No! You don't understand it;
this man plans for every fight

[An arrow strikes the last SUITOR, killing him.]

[SUITOR #5]
Where is he?
WHERE IS HE?!

[SUITOR #6]
Keep your head down
He's aiming for the torches

[SUITOR #7]
Our weapons, they're missing

[SUITOR #8]
He's using the darkness to hide his approaches

[SUITOR #9]
We're empty-handed
Up against an archer
Our only chance is to strike him in the darkness

[SUITOR #10]
We know these halls
The odds can be tilted!

[ODYSSEUS]
You don't think I know my own palace?
I BUILT IT!

[EURYMACHUS]
Old king, our leader is dead
You've destroyed the serpent's head
Now the rest of us are no longer a threat
Old king, forgive us instead
So that no more blood is shed
Let's have open arms instea-

[ODYSSEUS shoots EURYMACHUS]

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
No.

[AMPHINOMUS]
Damn, he's more cunning than I assumed
While we were busy plotting, he hid our weapons inside this room

[MELANTHIUS]
I find it hard to believe that the sharpest of kings
Left his armory unlocked

[AMPHINOMUS]
So what?
Now that we have armed ourselves
Let's make the bastard rot

[MELANTHIUS, spoken]
Behind you!

[TELEMACHUS stabs AMPHINOMUS]

[Instrumental Break]

[TELEMACHUS]
Throw down those weapons
And I'll ensure you'll be spared

[MELANTHIUS]
After seeing what the king will do to us
We wouldn't dare

[TELEMACHUS]
I don't want to hurt you
But trust me, I've come prepared

[MELANTHIUS]
Ha! Your very presence has doomed the king, young prince
We don't fight fair

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Stop!

[MELANTHIUS]
Brothers, we got company, and he's made a grave mistake
Left the weapons room unlocked, and now they're ours to take
Brothers, come and arm yourselves
There's a chance for us to win
We can still defeat the king if we all attack the prince!

[SUITORS]
Where is he? Where is he?

[MELANTHIUS]
Capture him, he's our greatest chance!

[TELEMACHUS]
Get off me! Get off me!

[MELANTHIUS]
Fight 'til the prince can barely stand

[SUITORS]
Hold him down! Hold him down!

[MELANTHIUS]
Make the king obey our command

[SUITORS]
Hold him down! Hold him down!

[MELANTHIUS]
'Cause if he won't, I'll break the kid's hands

[MELANTHIUS, spoken]
Got him!

[ODYSSEUS stabs MELANTHIUS]

[MELANTHIUS, spoken]
Mer...mer...

[ODYSSEUS]
Mercy? MERCY?!
My mercy has long since drowned
It died to bring me home
And as long as you're around
My family's fate is left unknown
You plotted to kill my son...
You planned to RAPE MY WIFE!
ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO DIE!!

[ENSEMBLE]
Odysseus

[ODYSSEUS]
You filled my heart with hate
All of you who've done me wrong
THIS WILL BE YOUR FATE!

[ODYSSEUS beheads MELANTHIUS' corpse.]
