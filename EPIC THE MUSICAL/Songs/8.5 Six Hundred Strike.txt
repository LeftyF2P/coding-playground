[ENSEMBLE]
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred

[ODYSSEUS]
I don't think you seem to get it,
I can't afford to die,
'Cause I will get back to my son,
And I will get back to my WIFE!!!

[Instrumental Break]

[ODYSSEUS]
For every comrade!
Every one of my friends!
Almost all of whom were slaughtered by your hand!
SIX HUNDRED STRIKE!!

[ENSEMBLE]
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred, six hundred men

[POSEIDON, spoken]
You idiot...

[POSEIDON]
Can't you see?
You sealed your fate just to beat me.
You released my storm when you opened that bag
Blocked your one way home

[POSEIDON, spoken]
Now, you'll never get back!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
You're going to call off that storm...

[POSEIDON, spoken]
Or what?
You can't kill me!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Exactly...

[ODYSSEUS picks up POSEIDON's Trident]

[POSEIDON, spoken]
Wait...
WAIT!!!
AH!!!
UGH!

[ODYSSEUS, POSEIDON]
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE HELPLESS?! (ARGH!!)
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW PAIN?! (UGH!!)
I WATCHED MY FRIENDS DIE IN HORROR! (AH!!)
CRYING AS THEY WERE ALL SLAIN! (UGH!)
I HEARD THEIR FINAL MOMENTS! (ARGH!)
CALLING THEIR CAPTAIN IN VAIN! (UGH!)
LOOK WHAT YOU TURNED ME INTO! (AH!!)
LOOK WHAT WE'VE BECOME! (UGH!)

[POSEIDON, spoken]
Enough…

[ODYSSEUS, POSEIDON]
ALL OF THE PAIN THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH! (Stop!)
HAVEN'T I SUFFERED ENOUGH?! (STOP!!!)

[ODYSSEUS]
YOU DIDN'T STOP WHEN I BEGGED YOU!!!
TOLD ME TO CLOSE MY HEART!!!

[POSEIDON, spoken]
You...

[ODYSSEUS, POSEIDON]
YOU SAID THE WORLD WAS DARK!!! (MONSTER!!!)

[ODYSSEUS]
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT RUTHLESSNESS IS MERCY UPON OUR-

[POSEIDON]
ALRIGHT!!!
Please...

[ODYSSEUS drops POSEIDON's Trident]

[POSEIDON, spoken]
After everything you've done...
...how will you sleep at night?!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...Next to my wife.
