# Playground

This is just my personal playground. Like 75% of these projects are just for me to dip my toes into things and most of them are at the most bare bones level of functionality.

## Things I want to work on next:
- Build a Password Manager to learn file handling, hashing (not full crypto)
- Build a URL Shortener to understand routing, IDs, and persistence
- Finish my Todo App with GO lang
- Build a Web Scraper to learn requests, parsing, and rate limits
- Build a CLI Expense Tracker to master logic, files, and edge cases
- Build a Log Analyzer to work with files, timestamps, and patterns
- Build a Simple Recommender using similarity rules (not ML magic)
- Build an Email Automation Script using SMTP and scheduling
